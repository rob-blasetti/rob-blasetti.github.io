      title: "Is Bitcoin Real Money?", 
      content: `It’s been in and out of the news, and in again. At first glance it seems like nothing worth paying attention to, a joke praised by out-of-touch internet nerds and ivory tower intellectuals.

      Is it believable that bitcoin has been going strong for 7 years? During this time no less than 86 articles have been written about the ‘death of bitcoin’, there is even a site dedicated to recording these bitcoin obituaries.
      
      
      At this point, it’s safe to say bitcoin is here to stay. So.. what is it exactly? Bitcoin refers to two things: Bitcoin is a payment network similar to Mastercard or Paypal, and bitcoins (the currency) are the medium of exchange on the bitcoin payment network. Bitcoin is a global currency, which is traded person to person without any need for a bank in the middle.
      
      If we are to be precise about the definition, for something to be used as money it needs to hold the following properties:
      
      Scarcity. There needs to be a finite supply so that the currency maintains its value. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, no person can create more bitcoins.
      
      Durability. This is an open and shut case, digital currency does not wear, tear or break.
      
      Fungibility. Each bitcoin is exactly the same as each other bitcoin.
      
      Divisibility. Each bitcoin (or BTC) is divisible down to 8 decimal places. A Millibit is 0.001 BTC, a Bit is 0.000001 BTC and a Satoshi is 0.00000001 BTC. For example, a coffee could one day cost 500 bits.
      
      Portability. A bitcoin can be stored on your phone, tablet, computer, or even a bitcoin specific hardware wallet. It weights nothing and is frictionless to move around. This is much better then lugging around a hunk of gold, or carrying a wallet of cash.
      
      Bitcoin may be the best form of money we have ever used. The table below represents how bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general compare to gold and sovereign currency as money.
      
      
      It is understood that money in lay terms refers to government issued sovereign currency, however throughout history civilisations have used many different mediums of money. Some of which are rocks, squirrels, jewels, wine and seashells. Every civilisation throughout history has had their form of money. Prior to sovereign currency, gold was the medium of trade for many nations, and to this day still is a very good store of value.
      
      As with any new currency, it will take time for adoption to grow. Whether bitcoin has been adopted as a currency or if it is going to be is a topic for another time.
      
      Seven years in bitcoin is still a very young currency, each day it remains active and secure it proves that bitcoin is standing the test of time. Bank notes and credit cards were not made for the internet, cryptocurrency enables digital transactions in the digital age.

      title: "6 Reasons Why Bitcoin Can’t Be A Currency", 
      content: `
      Digital money is a new field of technology, so naturally there is no shortage of skeptics, or people who have not heard about it at all.

It’s important to note that a direct comparison between bitcoin and the sovereign dollar isn’t helpful to justify if bitcoin can work as a currency. Many of the issues bitcoin has today, are merely symptoms of a small pool of users and will cease to exist if mass adoption occurs.

The following is a list of the most common arguments I have heard against bitcoin as a currency, and my opinion on them:

Bitcoin is too complicated, most people won’t understand how it works.
The way we transact with cash or card works just fine, though most people don’t understand the complexity of monetary policy and central banking. The same principal applies to bitcoins, with enough time people will feel comfortable that the technology is safe and trustworthy.

Bitcoins were used for illegal activity.
Bitcoins have been used as a tool for illegal activity, this was before regulations were put in place in many of the countries that have them now. The digital currency field has matured a lot in the last few years, some exchanges now offer insurance if your money is stolen.

As with a lot of truely disruptive technologies, before it is used by the masses to propel society forward, it will be taken advantage of by the fringe markets who’s needs aren’t satisfied. This means some illegal activity, but also international remittence, technologists, and traders. These businesses have the highest tolerance for risk, and they are willing to adapt to new technologies very quickly to get ahead of the law enforcement chasing them.

Technology is a neutral tool that can be constructive and destructive to society. It would be foolish to punish the technology a criminal is using instead of the criminal. Just like the internet, we will have many revolutionary societal gains from bitcoin technology, at the expense of some illegal innovations too. Looking back now, the internet has made it easier for criminals to communicate online just like everyone else, but would any of us prefer it was never invented?

“The internet was a den of thieves, pornographers, pirates and criminals but that doesn’t matter much now.” — Andreas Antonopoulos
Even if it wasn’t so complex, it’s too geeky and most people won’t want to use it.
Compare bitcoin to the evolution of email over the last two decades. Today we have an integrated experience, where social networks and online chat bleeds over into personal messaging. It wasn’t always the case, back then no one used email and it didn’t look as pretty as it does now. Bitcoin is now in the process of being made easy to use and a far more attractive user experience. We are seeing the emergence of mainstream appropriate digital wallets online and in the mobile app store.

Bitcoins are not based off anything.
It’s a common belief that money is based off gold, by this definition banks should have gold bars in them to represent the currency they hold. This is not the case, the reality is that there are very few currencies left in the world that are based off tangible gold. Gold has been used for thousands of years as a currency and it is not based off anything but our perception of its value.

Bitcoin is design to simulate the declining rate of gold mined out of the earth. Also there is a limit on the amount of bitcoins that will enter circulation; 21 million. Both of these properties give bitcoins a scarcity which contributes to its value.

“The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation.” -Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System, 2008
Take a look at my last blog post to see what properties a currency should have to be regarded as good quality money.

Bitcoins have no inherent or essential value.
Now that you have read my previous blog post, i’m sure you’ll know that bitcoins abide by the properties of money to a high standard, so they can be perceived as good quality money.

The essential value of Bitcoin comes from the network itself, there is no other technology that can allow you to make an instant money transfer to another person anywhere in the world.

Furthermore the bitcoin network, like the internet is a platform for innovation. Blogging, websites, search engines and social networks were built on the internet, the bitcoin network will give birth to financial tools which will be native to the internet age such as smart contracts, global crowdfunding and lending, and micro-payments. These potential applications should be considered as part of the essential value of the network. The exciting future of digital money will be further discussed in a later blog.

The price of bitcoin is too volatile.

The chart to the left shows bitcoins volatility has significantly decreased in the last few years. As the use of the currency increases the volatility should somewhat decrease. A major reason for this is that volatility is caused by a small liquidity pool in currency. When there is more money invested in the bitcoin network, investors buying and selling wont effect the price so much.

Another reason for the decreasing in volatility is the development of the tools that are used to trade financial products in Forex markets. Modern exchanges offer customers the ability to use mechanisms like shorting and futures trade to create price floors and ceilings, keeping the volatility to a minimum. Ideally, this will eventually give us the general level of stability we expect from currency markets.

      title: "Micro Bonds On The Blockchain", 
      content: `
      The latest buzzword in FinTech is Blockchain. ‘Do you have a blockchain strategy?’ Heres an interesting way the insurance industry can take advantage of the blockchain for an innovative new product.

      What is a blockchain?
      
      Storing transactional data on a single computer may be a convenient way to access information, but it leaves the data susceptible to the vulnerabilities of centralisation. The blockchain is a concept that refers to a network of computers which are all storing a copy of a database of transactions that is constantly kept synchronised. The blockchain also contains a native currency which is used for the transactions in the database. For more information on the first implementation of a Blockchain, refer to my blog on Bitcoin; the first digital currency.
      
      One of the ways businesses in the insurance industry can take advantage of Blockchain technology is by assessing how they can defer costs and risks to the blockchain. This is especially useful for small transactions, which may have not been practical previously due to costs and risks outweighing the benefits.
      
      Micro Bond
      
      A Micro Bond is a contract for a small portion of risk a customer can buy from an insurance company. See the examples provided below on how this can work.
      
      The Micro Bond requires the following two features of blockchain technology:
      
      Payment Locking: This feature allows you to make a transaction on the network that will be locked on the network at the point of issuance from the issuer, and the receiver until the provided period of time has elapsed.
      Multi-signature Transactions: A transaction that requires multiple signatures to be processed. For example in a 3 party multi-signature transaction, at least 2 of the 3 signatures must be signed before the transaction will be processed.
      Transaction Breakdown
      
      Here is an example of how this could work:
      
      
      The Enterprise Insurance Business with the capital to invest in business risk will purchase the small business risk for $10,000 covering the small business for theft, fire, etc. They can then sell this risk to individual customers in the public as micro bonds for $10 each(or less) on the blockchain.
      
      The enterprise will sell the Micro Bond to customers using the blockchain features ‘payment locking’ and ‘multi-signature transaction’ explained below.
      
      For example the enterprise business sells a 30 day Micro Bond to a customer for $10. The company holds two signatures in the multi-signature transaction and the customer holds the third. If the Micro Bond is not claimed by the enterprise business end of the 30 day period, the customer gives their signature and the company gives theirs to release the funds with the required 2 of 3 signatures. If the risk is claimed however, the company signs both signatures at the point of the risk lapse, which will send the funds back the the enterprise business.
      
      Business Efficiency
      
      The blockchain allows enterprise business to defer the cost and risk of a small insurance transaction to the network itself. On the blockchain the risk associated with issuing a Micro Bond is mitigated through the two technologies; Multi-Signature Transactions and Payment Locking. Without a blockchain the cost of a trusting the individual would likely outweigh the benefit of issuing the Micro Bond.

      title: "Legitimacy and the Ethereum Blockchain Split!",
      content: `The Ethereum blockchain has split in two! People who held ether at the time of the fork now have access to their Ethereum coins(ETH) as well as Ethereum Classic(ETC). This is a result of a recent hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain, so which coin is legitimate?

      After the recent DAO hack, associates of the Ethereum foundation wrote a patch which would reverse the hack event.
      
      A few days ago as of block 1920000 the patch took effect as planned and the blockchain continued running with the patch activated. An interesting event occurred at block 1920001. Some people chose not to take the patch on board, rather they secured the original chain with the DAO hack. The result is the aforementioned ETH/ETC outcome. As an owner of ether cryptocurrency prior to the fork, your ether wallet is now valid of both sides of the fork, thus having access to Ethereum(ETH) and what is now labeled Ethereum Classic(ETC).
      
      Some could have seen this coming, in the weeks leading up to the hack attitudes in the cryptocurrency community generally fell in one of two sides:
      
      The foundation and many in the community thought of the hack as theft, which should be corrected through intervention.
      Another group in the community has the perspective that the hacker managed to take the DAO funds through a security flaw, therefore it was fair game.
      An underlying issue here is about central intervention in a system which is based on community consensus.
      
      On one side of the fork (ETH) we had an intervention to patch the hack for the sake of the majority at the expense of immutability of the blockchain. On the other, we have a resistance of intervention to keep the chain authentic at the expense of the DAO investors.
      
      So where does legitimacy lie? Consider the following:
      
      Any code which is written to update Ethereum at this point can be applied to both ETC and ETH.
      Aside from the DAO patch both sides of the fork are still able to run Ethereum smart contracts and use any other associated ethereum features.
      In regards to the less endorsed chain Ethereum Classic, whether any person or business chooses to acknowledge its existence or not, at this point in time it does exist and the coins are claimable by anyone who has an Ethereum wallet.
      Whether you are in favour of the patched chain, or the original Ethereum chain, what we can learn from this is legitimacy is a matter of perspective.

      title: "The Cost Of Authorisation",
      content: `As a consultant for ThoughtWorks, recently I was given the opportunity to work on a project which involved a blockchain startup. One of our teams tasks was to bring financial integration to a web application, using an Ethereum cryptocurrency exchange.

      Our team quickly discovered a challenge when we started integrating with the exchange, transactions were slow to settle. This was not the fault of the payment provider directly, rather an inherent characteristic of a public blockchain.
      
      A public blockchain functions as a decentralised settlement system. There are key differences between the banks and regulatory bodies or our traditional settlement system and blockchain technology. One important one is the cost of settlement.
      
      Let’s look at some real life examples:
      
      Example One: Paypal
      
      If a customer buys a book on eBay using Paypal, Paypal takes on the settlement risk of the transaction. They act as an intermediary to the settlement entity; the bank. Therefore the payment provider Paypal offers immediate settlement for the consumer of the book, and takes on the risk of their settlement with the bank. This could go wrong for Paypal if the book the customer buys is not approved of in the interest of the bank, or if the consumer uses a fake or stolen credit card.
      
      Example Two: Blockchain
      
      The same customer wants to buy the book off eBay with the Ethereum cryptocurrency ether (pretend eBay takes ether as a form of payment). The transaction would apply for settlement on the blockchain at the point of sale. Let’s assume settlement time for an Ethereum transaction is one minute*. The benefit here is the settlement system will not impede on the free speech (consider money as a form of speech) of the consumer, because the protection standards of the governing body are based on one encoded outcome: reach consensus for all transactions on the network.
      
      Waiting a minute for a transaction to settle is a bad experience, even if we weren’t living in a time where three seconds is too slow for a webpage to load. Let’s put aside the known trend that in time technology will improve and some intelligent people will find a way to make blockchains more efficient.
      
      The point of these examples is there is no such thing as free settlement. If your settlement is immediate it comes at the cost of conformity to the protection standards of the governing body. If you settle on the blockchain, you may be able to make the transaction for free, and the blockchain doesn’t care what your transaction is for, but the cost you will pay is in units of time while the network comes to a consensus.
      
      So you might ask, why use a blockchain at all? Paypal works just fine, they offer consumer protection and I don’t have to wait for block confirmations.
      
      If you asked this, you would be correct, Paypal does work just fine! Unless you are living in a country like Turkey where Paypal has been blocked, or a country like Venezuela where the national currency has been hyper inflated and there aren’t many other options to buy your milk and bread.
      
      If we consider money as a form of speech do the same issues of internet privacy apply to currency? I think it depends what kind of world we want to leave for the next generation. We could leave a world where we offshore our responsibility to a body of custodians to give us a sense of safety in our community. Or a world where we are responsible for our spending and the consequences of our decisions. As the years go by we are given more examples of how fallible the people responsible for our currency (therefore our safety) are, the latter option might be more beneficial to society in the long run.
      
      Or a better answer might lie somewhere in the middle. We are already living in a world where we have available the privacy aspects of anonymous digital cash and the protective aspects of traditional banking. So long as they are happy to coexist, blockchains may not mean the end of centralised banking after all.
      
      *The average confirmation time for a block of transactions on Ethereum is 17 seconds. The standard for safe settlement should be at least 3 blocks worth of confirmations; therefore we can assume it takes roughly one minute to settle a transaction safely on the Ethereum blockchain.

      title: "How can I keep my bitcoins safe from…",
      content: `Bitcoin the cryptocurrency has made its way back into the media after it recently breached the $1,000 USD price per bitcoin. There is a growing number of threats which could take your bitcoins if you leave them on your computer, as a long term bitcoin evangelist I can tell you a hardware wallet is a necessity for safe and easy storage of your coins in 2017. Weather you have been a long term hodler or are thinking of investing in your first bitcoins soon, there is no safer way to store bitcoin than an offline hardware wallet. Here is a list of some of the most popular, and most reputable hardware wallets in the space.

      Trezor: The Bitcoin Safe
      
      Trezor is the oldest hardware wallet manufacturer in the space, they go for US$99 per device. If you wait for the right time of year you may be able to grab 3 for a discount from their website.
      
      
      When you setup a Trezor device it will generate a 24 word passphrase which is used as a backup in case you lose your device. Trezor holds your coins safe because transactions can only be made from the wallet when the device is plugged into a computer and your pin number is entered.
      
      Ledger Nano
      
      
      Ledger Nano
      For a cheaper and more familiar alternative pick up a Ledger Nano. You can purchase this familiar USB shaped device from their website for £29, or around $50 AUD. As a user of the Ledger Nano my experience was that it took some time to feel comfortable storing more than a little bit of change on this small lightweight device. Fortunately, Ledger also provides the standard 24 word backup phrase for their wallets so if anything goes awry you have a way of retrieving your funds. Go for a Ledger Nano hardware wallet if you want to store bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies like Ether, it’s unlikely you will find a wallet much cheaper than Ledger Nano.
      
      Ledger also has an alternative wallet called the Ledger Blue, which is a larger device with a screen. This will feel more comfortable for people who prefer a tablet to keep their coins safe, it retails for £229.
      
      Keepkey
      
      The keepkey wallet is certainly on the better looking end of the hardware wallet range. With its glass finish and glossy black colour, keepkey is a wallet that takes bitcoin out of the realm of nerdy internet money.
      
      
      The keepkey comes with a woven nylon USB cord, leather backup card sleeve and Anodized Aluminum casing. Look no further for a high quality hardware wallet, the founders have certainly paid close attention to the design aspects of the wallet.
      
      You can pick one of these up for $99 USD from their website.
      
      These are just a few of the wallets in the expanding bitcoin hardware wallet range. I feel safest using the Trezor because it has always served me well for a few years. Pick up any of these hardware wallets and you can rest easy knowing your bitcoins are safe.
      
      One last special mention needs to be given to Opendime. They shook up the hardware space last year with their flagship product.
      
      Opendime
      
      
      Opendime functions as more of a barer bond than a hardware wallet. Also known as a Bitcoin Credit Stick or Bitcoin Stick, they are the latest addition to the bitcoin hardware range. Opendime is intended to be loaded up with bitcoin and passed from person to person similar to using physical cash. This wouldn’t be ideal for long term storage, but if you are interested in trying out cutting edge hardware you will want to try an Opendime. You can pick up 3 for about $100 (USD) here.`,

      title: "Here’s why your business doesn’t need a blockchain",
      content: `As a software consultant at Thoughtworks I get to talk to people in many different fields about how we can improve their business with technology. Detailed here are some lessons I learnt in my experience providing consulting advice about blockchain technology.

      Blockchain is very interesting because many people recognise it is going to have an impact on society, however thus far it has been a struggle to find solutions that are going to work. Let’s discuss some of the reasons why it can be hard to integrate public blockchain technology in traditional business models.
      
      Public Access
      
      Immutability and transparency for all has been touted as a key feature of blockchain. What is not discussed that often is the trade off between immutability and customer protection. As a society we prefer to have businesses control our information because we can appeal to them if there are cases of fraud, theft or other undesirable behaviour. An example of this is that it is a good thing my local bank can reverse a payment to the wrong person.
      
      Throughput
      
      One of the dreamy ideals in the blockchain space is we can verify everything on the blockchain, we wont need to appeal to any central authority and everyone will have the ability to set in stone any information they like.
      
      The trade off here is that settlement on a blockchain is not free. The reason we can advertise how cheap cryptocurrency transactions are right now is because the network has not developed a fee market yet. In the future if many people around the world want to settle information on a public blockchain the fees required to settle will increase. This will likely be more expensive than our traditional financial system. The reason for this is there is a limit on the amount of information in each block on the blockchain, which was enforced as a network rule to prevent Sybil attacks with negligible transactions and spam, and also blockchain bloat which will be discussed below.
      
      Granted, there are solutions to this problem like layer two payment channels: see lightning network. However even with technological advancements the general issue remains; settlement is not free. In the world of public blockchains settlement fees will likely fluctuate on the way to greater adoption.
      
      Privacy
      
      Using a public blockchain for any kind of verification offers the ability for people to keep their identity private. The thing about technology used to empower people and better the nature of society, generally it isn’t good for business.
      
      If a public blockchain is used to verify real currency for an individual, they are in control of the funds. A bank on the other hand depends on controlling the funds that are allocated to an individual because part of their business involves using these funds to invest in other projects and operating at a fractional reserve.
      
      Public Code And Security
      
      Smart Contracts have been all the rage for the last year in the blockchain space, but they are not without their share of issues. The main efficiency which is hooking technologists here is the idea that we can automate away pieces of management structure with ‘code as law’. The Smart Contract would be able to carry out business processes on the public blockchain.
      
      Generally businesses are not interested in giving away their trade secrets to the public. So why would they want to put major portions of their core codebase on a public blockchain?
      
      A blaring issue with this is security, we need only look at the recent DAO hack to find real life experience of what it’s like to deal with buggy public code on a blockchain. The Ethereum Blockchain had to perform three hard forks after the hack, one of which ended in a split in the currency. Read more about the Ethereum hard fork split in my recent blog. It is very difficult to issue bug fixes when you don’t have central access to your codebase, having a turing complete Smart Contract language on a Blockchain is dangerous to say the least.
      
      Public Blockchain Bloat
      
      Another current issue with Smart Contracts is blockchain bloat, the nodes which support the network have to store the entire database history of all the Smart Contracts that have run on the network. This mean that there is an exponentially high cost to having the blockchain take on additional responsibilities. A public blockchain such as bitcoin works well because it does one thing and one thing only.
      
      The health of the network depends on the amount of nodes, and their spread across the world. Blockchain bloat will decrease the amount of nodes able to participate in securing the network as the space required to store the blockchain database becomes so large that some nodes don’t have the capacity to keep up.
      
      If businesses were to use this blockchain as a fundamental technology in their infrastructure, they would have to be weary of the health of the public blockchain network.
      
      Conclusion
      
      So is public blockchain technology a solution waiting for a problem? These technologies are platforms for innovation just like the internet, in my opinion it is likely businesses of the future will be built on top of them for future generations rather than being integrated with traditional businesses.

      title: "Assessing The Weak Points Of Blockchain Technology",
      content: `There are many benefits to be gained from public blockchain technology for society as a whole. I am concerned that in the haze of blockchain fever, we have forgotten the benefits of our tradition systems of validation. For example we can verify education certificates on a blockchain, but the choice of if we would want to is up for dispute. Let’s go through some of the reasons why we need a combination of centralised and decentralised validation systems.


      #1 There is no customer protection on the blockchain.
      
      Blockchain technology operates as a push-based settlement system. This means the individual holds the power over the resource they want to verify on the blockchain. This could be cryptocurrency, certificate authentication, land titles etc. The problem with this is if a transaction goes sour after it has already been verified on the blockchain, the only feasible way of returning the transaction is if the parties agree to reverse it. Using a centralised system like a bank however, there is a procedure in place to be able to dispute trades after they are complete.
      
      Some trade technologies that settle on a blockchain have used an arbiter system to fix this problem, an example of this is the Open Bazaar P2P trade network. This way a trade occurs between two people, and one impartial moderator. See multi-signature transaction technology for details on how this works.
      
      #2 Settlement on a blockchain is slow.
      
      A cost of settling a transaction on the blockchain is that all the nodes in the network need to come to an agreement that the transaction is valid. This is a far slower process than having a bank verify your transaction in an instant.
      
      Transactions can be made instantaneously, however until the block in which the transaction is inserted in has been verified, it is classified is untrustworthy. In the time between a lodged transaction is made and when the block settles, a bad actor could launch fraudulent transactions to trick the network into what is known as a double-spend.
      
      A very exciting upcoming technology that could solve this problem is the lightning network. This solution acts as a layer 2 of blockchain technology, it can be applied to any public blockchain. It will enable instantly verified transactions for a fraction of the cost of todays settlement. Read more about how this works here.
      
      #3 Miners can be selfish
      
      The mining process on the blockchain is a innovation which uses game theory economics to incentivise people to commit computer power for securing the network for a profit. The down side of this is generally miners wont care about settling as many transactions as possible, they will make the most money by finding and verifying a block in the fastest way possible.
      
      This leads to a problem of miners finding empty blocks and validating. There is also another problem known as Selfish Mining, which is a situation where a miner or mining pool finds and validates a block and does not publish and distribute a valid solution to the rest of the network.
      
      #4 The growing blockchain size
      
      With every new block a blockchain grows in size. This can be an issue because each node that is validating the network needs to store the entire history of the blockchain in order to be a participant. This is a hard enough problem with the bitcoin blockchain where the transaction size is only a few bytes, the total blockchain size as of January 2017 is 98GB. Given that at the same time in 2016 the size was 50GB, and the use of the blockchain is continuing to increase, this is a growing concern.
      
      One of the biggest debates in the bitcoin space is if the block size should be increased. If a blockchain has bigger blocks the blockchain size will increase faster, thus weeding out the solo miners eventually. This is a big issue because the health of a blockchain network is partially dependant on the amount of nodes in the network, and the spread of those nodes across the world. The counter argument for this issue is that with sufficient advancement of technology hard disk space will be very cheap in the future and will stay ahead of the blockchain size. The debate is ongoing.
      
      #5 Eventually settlement on the blockchain will not be cheap
      
      On any public blockchain, space in a block is a finite resource. Necessarily as the network is utilised more the amount of transactions that will want to settle in a block will exceed the storage capacity. Public blockchain networks have a solution built in for this which is that transactions with a higher miner fee attached will get precedence to be included in a block. This makes sense because the miners want to maximise their profit so they will include transactions with the highest fees first.
      
      This is not a bug, but a feature. If it was free to settle on the blockchain, there would be far too many ways of attacking the blocks with dust transactions and clogging up the network. Originally the bitcoin blockchain had no block size limit, this was eventually set to 1MB to avoid a Sybil Attack on the network.
      
      All of these problems have potential solutions that can be implemented as a fix. In my view blockchains will eventually have a layers of centralisation like the lightning network, however this is not a bad thing so long as there is a sufficient amount of encryption to protect the privacy of the people who want to use the centralised layers of the network.`,

      title: "What You Need To Know About The Bitcoin Scaling Debate",
      content: `The contentious scaling debate dividing the bitcoin community for over two years now is heating up again. Given that there are groups of people which have a different idea of what ‘success’ means for the bitcoin network, we will continue to have political debates so long as the technology continues to grow. Scaling debates are simply a growing pain of a technology that has become too successful for its current form. The scaling issue has been communicated as the ‘Block Size Debate’. This is primarily because the limit on how many transactions can be put into each block on the bitcoin blockchain is now being challenged by high demand from users. Currently there is a 1MB limit on the size of blocks on the blockchain, which means the network itself can only handle about 7 transactions per second.

      Why have a Block Size Limit at all?
      
      We might think why have a limit on the block size at all? Originally when the software was released in 2009 there was no limit on the block size. The limit was later implemented by Satoshi Nakamoto to protect the growing network against spam transactions from bad actors.
      
      The network has a fee market built in, so that when blocks are being filled to 1MB the transactions with the highest fees attached to them will get priority to be added to the current block for confirmation on the network. The rest of the transactions will have to wait for a later block for inclusion.
      
      There is an understanding by most people in the industry that the network is now in a position where the block size needs to scale. This is because it has achieved significant growth over the last few years, and soon transactions will become too expensive for users due to high demand of the network.
      
      The Main Contenders
      
      There are three outcomes that could result from the current scaling debate.
      
      Bitcoin Core - Segregated Witness (SegWit)
      
      The Bitcoin Core team developed a solution to be able to increase the amount of transactions in a block, without increasing the block size limit. They called this SegWit because it separates the verification signature from a transaction which is entered into a block. Here’s an example, let’s pretend a transaction is 60 bytes, 20 of those bytes might be used for a verification signature which is only needed at the point when miners insert the transaction into a block. SegWit allows miners to remove that signature, thereby allowing more space in a block.
      
      This solution also fixed a long standing issue with the network called Transaction Malleability. If a transaction is malleable there is a possibility of manipulation before it is confirmed on the network. Sounds dangerous? It is. Malleability contributed to the collapse of the first bitcoin exchange back in 2013, known as MtGox.
      
      Bitcoin Unlimited
      
      
      Bitcoin Unlimited is taking a different approach to block size. Rather than having a hard coded limit to the network they are allowing the miners to choose their block size limit. The bitcoin Unlimited ethos is advocating for removing the only point of central control from the network; the block size limit. To this group of people success for bitcoin is to just let the network workout its scale as it goes, because they don’t believe there is a need for the block size limit at all.
      
      The bitcoin Core team is a loosely connected group of individuals worldwide, many of which have been contributing to the bitcoin blockchain for at least 5 years. Bitcoin Unlimited is a recent fork of the Bitcoin Core software. Comparatively if you look at the activity on the GitHub repositories since May 2016, if you exclude Core developers only seven developers worked on the Unlimited implementations, while on Core you see 39 developers contributing.
      
      The risk factor of this difference in development effort is compounded by the lack of peer review of the Bitcoin Unlimited source code. Recently this contributed to a pool running Bitcoin Unlimited software mining an invalid block on the bitcoin network due to an error in the software. This cost the pool 12.5 BTC or approximately USD $12,000. Software upgrades to the bitcoin network have been compared to trying to change the parts on a plane mid flight, it needs to be treated very carefully as there are billions of dollars that are at risk when changes are made.
      
      Nothing gets adopted
      
      There is a chance that none of the solutions get adopted and the network stays as it stands today. This might seem like a failure, however the network is working just fine as it is now. However if demand increases as the community expects it to, the result will be very high fees for settling a transaction on the bitcoin network.
      
      The Tension In SegWit Adoption
      
      Generally SegWit has the support of the whole community because most people want the bitcoin network to scale, so you might ask why this is so difficult? Many pools have already said they support SegWit, however there is a main tension point between some of the largest miners in China like AntMiner and the expectations from the Core team.
      
      The main issue is that there was an agreement put into place that SegWit would be accepted if an increase to the overall block size to 2MB had also been made. This was thought to have been a simple deal to satisfy both the large mining pools and the core team. However as of present there has been no implementation of a bock size increase to 2MB, and on the Bitcoin Core website there has been talk of SegWit giving the block size a ‘theoretical’ increase to 4MB due to the amount it has cut down transaction sizes.
      
      As it stands both Bitcoin Cores SegWit and Bitcoin Unlimited have fluctuated at around %25–30 of votes from the miners on the network. Will the block size issue be resolved with peaceful agreement between Core and the Miners? Or will people get fed up and start looking towards Bitcoin Unlimited, or give up hope on scaling altogether. Your guess is as good as mine.`,

      title: "Brace Yourself For The Bitcoin Hard Fork",
      content: `Due to the escalating social tensions between the Core Developers and the miners which have influence over the network, it is looking more likely by the day that the bitcoin network will undergo a hard fork. If this event is to occur, the outcome could be similar to the hard fork the Ethereum network experienced last year, where we were left with two cryptocurrencies in the aftermath.


      If you haven’t read up on the motivations of each camp, read my previous blog: What You Need To Know About The Bitcoin Scaling Debate.
      
      Assuming the hard fork is to occur, the bitcoin community will have to choose which currency they believe is the true bitcoin; Core or Unlimited. The big question here is how do we determine the source of truth, and which side is it on? Also, could both sides of the fork survive?
      
      Source Of Truth
      
      One of the complex ideas that is inherent to blockchain technology is the determination of what is the source of truth, or in this context what chain do you trust when the blockchain forks in two. Cryptocurrency is dissimilar to our traditional currency system, because the legitimacy of the currency is decided by a community rather than a centralised entity. There is a common understanding in the bitcoin community that the longest chain is the source of truth, which essentially means that the software that the majority of miners are consuming is what we legitimately know as the real bitcoin.
      
      As a challenge to this thought I believe that the legitimacy of a blockchain is dependant on the attitude of the total ecosystem, not just the miners. For example in this case of Core vs. Unlimited there are large mining pools which have taken an interest in consuming Unlimited software. In a favourable circumstance, once they have the majority of hashing power in the mining space, they could fork the network and create a second bitcoin. The total community would have to decide what they see as the legitimate coin; which could be either or both coins. At this point in the example the playing field would dictate the following:
      
      On the one hand we have the Bitcoin Core chain, which now has the minority of hashing power. Many exchanges have already advocated their support for this chain if a fork is to occur. Though the Core chain would have a minority of hashing power, it would have the majority of business advocacy and likely the support of many of the long term holders who support Core.
      Then we have the Bitcoin Unlimited chain, which contains the majority of hashing power, but a minority of businesses interested in legitimising the chain. Due to the exploit vulnerabilities in Bitcoin Unlimited it is unlikely that there are many stakeholders aside from the largest mining entities which want this software to overtake the network.
      It is possible that though the miners place their majority hash power on the Bitcoin Unlimited chain, if the users and businesses strongly believe the smaller Core chain is the source of truth the miners will face the choice of switching back to Core or losing a lot of money. Therefore is is not necessarily true that the longest chain is the source of truth.
      
      Survival Of The Fittest
      
      The likelihood that there will be two equally valuable bitcoins is low. The huge conflict here is the miners will not mine a coin that no one wants to use, and the users and businesses will not use a coin that is not validated by the miners.
      
      Either way it is important to keep in mind that if you hold bitcoin before the fork occurs, once it has occurred you now hold that amount of bitcoin on both chains. For example if you have 10 bitcoins before the fork, you now have 10 Bitcoin Core(BTC) coins and 10 Bitcoin Unlimited(BTU) coins. Once the fork occurs, everyone will be faced with the choice of:
      
      You could sell your BTC coins for BTU
      You could sell your BTU coins for BTC
      You could hold both your coins of BTC and BTU and wait until the dust settles.
      High Risk Forking
      
      It is important to note that if Bitcoin Unlimited attempts to fork the chain without a strong majority of mining support, they will cause a lot of damage to the bitcoin brand and community by doing so. Given that the miners are profit driven, it is in everyones interest for a possible hard fork to play out as clean as possible. Long term Bitcoin advocate and Bitcoin Unlimited supporter Roger Verr has stated strongly the fork will not occur without a strong majority of miners supporting it (90%). He has high hopes that this number can be achieved.
      
      The potential hard fork might be stressful for people who are new to the bitcoin space, however with growth comes a bit of pain. Bare in mind the only reason we have this scaling issue is because the demand to use the bitcoin network is at an all time high, the resolution of the debate is required for the network to advance to a higher capacity of users.`,

      title: "Is your crypto portfolio completely worthless?",
      content: `It’s been a while since my last blog entry, mainly because I hadn’t found a topic I was inspired enough to write about. There is a topic that has been on my mind a bit recently though. I get a lot of opportunities to talk to new comers in the crypto space and the general questions that have come up most recently are mainly around one issue: What makes a cryptocurrency valuable?

      A while ago I wrote a piece on the value of bitcoin where I compared it to scarce metals like gold, find that here. The intention of this piece is to share my personal insight and understanding about the intangible reasons which I believe give cryptocurrencies value, this rests on the obvious premise that I am just another speculator watching in awe as the global economic stage evolves in front of us.
      
      One of the most common misconceptions I hear from newcomers investing in cryptocurrencies is the assessment of asset value based solely on business measures. For example, one currency could be more successful because the blockchain network they use settles transactions a in 5 minutes instead of 10 minutes. If you want a fast transaction for your coffee you can use our traditional banking systems, for the most part they are near immediate. In the crypto space these business measures are still relevant, however what is more valuable is the brand and reputation a currency and its founders hold true.
      
      A currency is created with a set of values and a belief paradigm that are instilled by its maker(s). Just like any technology, it is a tool with a purpose and the potential of a culture. These intangible properties are pervasive throughout the life of the currency, like a natural organism. A more familiar analogy to this is branding and reputation of clothing.
      
      The reason one or many will ‘win out’ in the end difficult to predict because cryptocurrencies are the first voluntary currencies. That might sound like libertarian dibble, but the reality is the invention of these currencies mean that over time we will begin to choose our beliefs and values more consciously. It logically follows that we will then use a criteria to choose these values.
      
      The people who are on the cutting edge of these technologies are the culture creators. They consist of all kinds of creative artists, philosophers and poets etc. They have a built in criteria to critically assess the value of these inventions by the strength and adherence to the founders vision and the authenticity and embodiment of their values. Consciously or otherwise, these bell-ringers are choosing what to relay up the chain to early adopters and sometime later the market majority.
      
      Here’s a concrete example: John creates FrenchFriesCoin and proclaims to the people ‘this is the coin that should be used to buy french fries, everywhere!’. If no one knows anything about John except that he made this coin, the value will be mainly speculative gambling. There is almost zero chance anyone would use that to buy fries, because we have no reason to trust or believe John.
      
      However if the founder is someone held in high esteem with a relevant vision and ideals they embody or attach themselves to, then a culture is formed and some people may listen. Let’s pretend Gandhi created PeaceCoin, which he used for trading in his community. Some people might have actually followed his behaviour, and a valuable cryptocurrency would have been created! The essential ideal here is that the stronger the vision and adherence to ideals of the creators, the stronger the culture will be created.
      
      It is debatable weather anyone the culture creators divine as ‘worthy’ would be enough of a megalomaniac to create their own currency. This is a reason bitcoin works so well, the founders vision and values cling to the invention without their flawed humanity destroying the cultural potential. Hopefully this perspective has given you another way you can asses the value of cryptocurrencies.

      title: "Why you won’t use a Smart Contract",
      content: `The Ethereum network and its cryptocurrency ether had a euphoric rise over an intensely small period of time. Just one year ago at the start of 2017 one ether token was valued at $10 USD, and it reached meteoric heights of over $1300 one year later, in January 2018. This could be attributed to the starry optimism about the potential of smart contracts and DAOs to revolutionise society the same way ‘blockchain technology’ was touted to revolutionise finance. Much like the blockchain buzz though, the promise of smart contracts seem to have fizzled at launch.

      Smart Contracts For Dummies
      
      For anyone not up to date with crypto-lingo, here’s the 101.
      
      A smart contract is essentially a contract for a cryptocurrency transaction with conditions involved. Rather than just sending 1 ether from Alice to Bob, a smart contract could write ‘send 1 ether to Bob if my horse wins the race, otherwise don’t send anything.’ Code that in the Solidity Programming Language and lodge it on the Ethereum network on just like magic you have yourself a Smart Contract. Almost…
      
      The Missing Ingredient
      
      There is one particular characteristic of a smart contract ceases to pierce the veil of media attention. This feature is the real reason why smart contracts haven’t been very successful thus far, barring the many many gambling apps and pyramid schemes. There needs to be an enforcing body to enact a smart contract, known as an Oracle. An independent source of truth must verify that conditions in the contract occurred in order to fulfil the obligation.
      
      If the contract is solely based on digital information then this oracle role can be fulfilled by a bot scraping data from the internet. However when things happen in the real world there are usually differing opinions of how event occur, and i don’t think most people would trust an AI machine to feed them the ‘truth’ of world and local events.
      
      This might work when everything is completely anonymous. An oracle could have a good reputation based on rational reliability. However a community is built around shared values, when this technology collides with the material world oracles will need more than a rational reputation.
      
      So who would be seen as favourable enough to gain the status of an oracle that the people trust? The only alternatives to AI is a body of people or an individual. It seems to me that the secret sauce is in the character of individuals within a community, people with a favourable character would be seen as reputable enough to be oracles for smart contracts.
      
      Fact Vs Value
      
      The oracle problem is one that has reached an inevitable stopping point in the blockchain space, possibly more of a calm before the storm. In tech we have a tendency to rationalise away values in a way that makes us susceptible to the kind of naiveté that comes with the belief that technology can solve people problems.
      
      A likely next stop on the blockchain train is that in order for smart contracts to be made useful and ensure there is little tension with the traditional societal structure, we will make Oracles as AI centric as possible. If only we could just get an AI bot to scrape news from the internet and tell us what’s true. Problems solved, right? Well no, in these post-modern times we are waking up to the recognition that truth is subjective. The AI Oracle will have its politics built into it because a party has to fund it, and that party has a desire for how their funded oracle should sensor information.
      
      What’s coming
      
      The Oracle problem can seemingly be solved by rational AI. At best this will give us a short view of what acceptable truth is, like facebook censoring what they believe fake news it.
      
      Smart contracts still have a ways to go before making any real impact on the world. The DAO hack debacle likely shook the faith in their short term potential. In the longer term though we need to recognise that there was a cost to building a trust-less foundation to society on blockchain technology. Eventually the layers of trust must be reintroduced. Oracles in smart contracts are a blaring reminder of that.`,

      title: "How many oracles does it take to validate a smart contract?",
      content: `One of the problems that make smart contracts difficult to get practical use in the real world is the validating oracle. For example if we have a smart contract which reads that Alice will pay Bob $5 if he shouts advertising in an overseas department store for one hour, how does the contract know Bob completed the task? Let’s explore the possible answers to this problem.

      Individual Oracles
      
      If a sole individual is to validate the contract through recognition of the event, the burden of trust falls on their reputation. Necessarily we need to have a reliable reputation framework to validate the trust of the individual, which even still is susceptible to possible risks. Bribery, fraud etc. An individual acting as an oracle in a trustless system should have a reward for truthful validation that outweighs the reward of bad behaviour. Alternatively the cost of fraudulent behaviour should be severe in order to keep oracles honest. The reputation must be so valuable as to outweigh the reward of currency itself, therefore we have a system of reward and punishment that works to keep oracle quality high. Until we have a digital culture ready for such weighty reputations, individual oracles are unlikely to succeed as trustworthy roles.
      
      Following a theme of cryptocurrency it’s likely we should look outside of centralised sources, at least until decentralised reputation systems become more robust.
      
      Market of Oracles
      
      The event observation could be delegated to a group of oracles. This would spread the bad actor risk and insure a more trustworthy truth finding process. The contract would listen to an answer only when a significant majority of oracles have claimed that the event occurred. Opening the process up to a group would create an incentive market for being an oracle. For example the first few people to witness the contract may be rewarded more than the later few, and a reliable oracle may take precedence over one with less experience.
      
      Using the real world example set out above, if the contract for Bob shouting advertising is witnessed by many people online, and several of them see him in the department store shouting they may go and validate the contract individually. When the first witness validates the contract there is a possibility of bad acting, when a few more witnesses from the department store validate the contract we have evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the event happened and the reward incentive can be released based on the order specified in the contract.
      
      During this early phase of the crypto-economic movement the required reputation systems and oracle frameworks have yet to be developed. From the arguments presented in this article it seems reasonable that smart contracts might first be validated by multiple oracles rather than a single reputable source.`,

      title: "Crypto Identity Management, Enforcement and Environment",
      content: `Recently Microstrategy unveiled a solution for Distributed Identifiers (DIDs) on the bitcoin blockchain. On-chain identity is a nut crypto pioneers have been trying to crack for many years. It’s a difficult problem because it’s a solution in need of a proper environment, which cannot so much be prescribed as it is chosen by a community. Heralded by some as a timely solution for identity management on the blockchain, and scoffed at by others as the worst exploitation of the bitcoin chain since ordinals. Let’s have a look at the identity management problem.

      One thing is clear, in order for the crypto industry to mature into well functioning communities we need an identity system that is persistent, immutable and accepted by the field as a standard.
      
      There have been many example attempts of identity management on-chain. Back in 2015 Vinny Lingham's Civic set out to sort out identity management, they issued a Civic pass and required a government issued ID to get you started. Vitalk detailed a solution for identity management on the Ethereum chain through the use of Soulbound Tokens, through an NFT that is bound to an Etheruem account you have a kind of identity management that could essentially be passed from person to person by giving away the keys to the account. 
      
      Herein lies the issue, is identity supposed to be bound to a human? If so, we need some sort of institution to verify the identity and tie it back to real life. If not, then it is enough that an identity can be bound to an account, and passed from person to person. At the heart of this issue is a deeply philosophical notion: Is identity a personal choice or does a historical identity trump your preference? If we don’t pin down digital identity on a human person, then there’s no way of ensuring the responsibility of that person to a society. To accumulate trust on that identity would be risky at best.
      
      This notion can be extended to the entire blockchain field. Exactly what is it that we are building here? If the blockchain is simply a better money system, that’s one thing, but if we are innovating on governance that hits at the depth of how our society is structured. Looping back to our question about identity and the environment in which this innovation will be successful, it will have to deal with questions of law and order and how they are enforced. Rewards and publications will accrue on an identity when actions are made, just like in typical society. If the blockchain code is used to enforce law and order, the identity profile will have to be penalized or rewarded by the environment based on its actions.
      
      This could well be the inception of a new way to structure a digital society. In this society an individuals' personhood and the laws that keep them in check are not enforced by fallible humans but rather agreed upon through a governance system and enforced by the code in the environment. As radically different as this is, it could be the beginning of a new kind of society where transparency leads the way in an individuals civic life but also in economy and government, allowing for a kind of flourishing of human potential that we have never seen before, and a mitigation of corruption. Luckily we have the digital world to use as a test bed for these ideas before they hit too close to home in the real world, we can only hope our transition to a cryptoworld will be smooth.
